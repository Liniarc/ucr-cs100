100 / 100

-5 Makefile doesn't work if the bin folder already exists

+5 extra credit for a nice README and project layout

-10 when you type a command that doesn't exist, the program dies (lookup "exceptions" in haskell, and the "try"/"catch" functions to fix this problem)

+10 extra credit for username/hostname in prompt
